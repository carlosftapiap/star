# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

This project is configured for **Firebase App Hosting**. The settings are in the `apphosting.yaml` file.

To deploy your application, you'll need to have the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed and be logged into your Firebase account (`firebase login`).

Once ready, you can deploy the app by running the following command from your project's root directory:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This command will build your Next.js application and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting.
